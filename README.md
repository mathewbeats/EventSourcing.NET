# EventSourcing.NET
This project implements an Event Sourcing pattern to manage student data. Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern that ensures every state change of a student is stored as a sequence of events. This approach provides a robust audit trail, allows easy reconstruction of past states, and supports a flexible, decoupled design.
